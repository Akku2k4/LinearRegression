This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression using Python, focusing on understanding the relationship between variables and making accurate predictions.

- Tools & Libraries
Python — Primary programming language

Pandas — Data manipulation and analysis

NumPy — Numerical computations

Scikit-learn — Model building and evaluation

Seaborn — Data visualization

- What I Did
Explored and visualized the dataset to identify patterns and correlations

Preprocessed the data to ensure it was clean and model-ready

Built and trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn

Evaluated model performance using metrics like R² score and Mean Squared Error
