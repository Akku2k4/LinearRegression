This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression using Python, focusing on understanding the relationship between variables and making accurate predictions.

ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries
Python â€” Primary programming language

Pandas â€” Data manipulation and analysis

NumPy â€” Numerical computations

Scikit-learn â€” Model building and evaluation

Seaborn â€” Data visualization

ðŸš€ What I Did
Explored and visualized the dataset to identify patterns and correlations

Preprocessed the data to ensure it was clean and model-ready

Built and trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn

Evaluated model performance using metrics like RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error

This project served as a hands-on introduction to regression techniques and the machine learning workflow using Python.
